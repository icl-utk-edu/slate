About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale (SLATE) is being developed
as part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP),
which is a joint project of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science
and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).
SLATE will deliver fundamental dense linear algebra capabilities
for current and upcoming distributed-memory systems,
including GPU-accelerated systems as well as more traditional multi core-only systems.

SLATE will provide coverage of existing LAPACK and ScaLAPACK functionality,
including parallel implementations of Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS),
linear systems solvers, least squares solvers, and singular value and eigenvalue solvers.
In this respect, SLATE will serve as a replacement for LAPACK and ScaLAPACK,
which, after two decades of operation, cannot be adequately retrofitted
for modern, GPU-accelerated architectures.

SLATE is built on top of standards, such as MPI and OpenMP,
and de facto-standard industry solutions such as NVIDIA CUDA and AMD HIP.
SLATE also relies on high performance implementations of numerical kernels from vendor libraries,
such as Intel MKL, IBM ESSL, NVIDIA cuBLAS, and AMD rocBLAS.
SLATE interacts with these libraries through a layer of C++ APIs.
This figure shows SLATE's position in the ECP software stack.

The charts shows how heavily ECP applications depend
on dense linear algebra software.
A direct dependency means that the application's source code
contains calls to the library's routines.
An indirect dependency means that the application needs to be linked with the library
due to another component depending on it.
Out of 60 ECP applications, 38 depend on BLAS - either directly on indirectly -
40 depend on LAPACK, and 14 depend on ScaLAPACK.
In other words, the use of dense linear algebra software is ubiquitous
among ECP applications.
