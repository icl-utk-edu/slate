///          [         ]  <== if k1 > k, all-zero rows are ignored
///
/// Depending on m, k, l, there are several cases for A2.
/// Currently, SLATE supports only cases 1, 2, and 3.
/// It assumes m = min( A2.mb, A2.nb ), and l = m or l = 0.
///
/// Case 1: m = k = l, A2 is upper triangular.
/// Example with m = k = l = 4.
///
///     A2 = [ . . . . ]  <== l-by-k upper triangular
///          [   . . . ]
///          [     . . ]
///          [       . ]
///          [- - - - -]
///          [         ]  <== if m2 > m, all-zero rows are ignored
///
/// Case 2: m < k and l = min( m, k ) = m, A2 is upper trapezoidal (wide).

///          [   . . . ]
///          [     . . ]
///
/// Case 3: l = 0, A2 is just the rectangular portion.
/// Currently unused in SLATE, but should work.
/// Example with m = 3, l = 0, k = 4.
///
///     A2 = [ . . . . ]  <== m-by-k rectangular
///          [ . . . . ]
///          [ . . . . ]
///
/// Case 4: m > k and l = k, A2 is upper trapezoidal (tall).
/// Currently unsupported in SLATE; would require explicitly passing m.
/// Example with m = 6, l = k = 4.

///          [       . ]

/// Case 5: 0 < l < min( m, k ), A2 is upper pentagonal.

///
/// After factoring, the vector representing the elementary reflector H(i) is in
/// the i-th column of the (m + k)-by-k matrix V:
///
///     V = [ I  ] <== k-by-k identity
///         [ V2 ] <== m-by-k pentagonal, same form as A2.
///
/// Thus, all of the information needed for V is contained in V2, which
/// has the same form as A2 and overwrites A2 on exit.
///
/// The number of blocks is r = ceiling( k/ib ), where each
/// block is of order ib except for the last block, which is of order
/// rb = k - (r-1)*ib. For each of the r blocks, an upper triangular block
/// reflector factor is computed: T1, T2, ..., Tr. The ib-by-ib (and rb-by-rb
/// for the last block) T's are stored in the ib-by-k matrix T as
///
///     T = [ T1 T2 ... Tr ]
///
/// Note: compared to LAPACK, A is renamed here => A1, B => A2, W => V,
/// V => V2, and n => k. This makes k match k in tpmqrt.
